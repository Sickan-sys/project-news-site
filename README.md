 Sometimes it feels like I'm just pressing a bunch of buttons and see what happens. Please let me know if something's wrong with the link. Or if you could se that I have imported the project the wrong way. Should I be Honest and say that this is my third try at the project. It is very basic.
 
 Ad more links to social media. With some form of effect on icons. Maybe have a more responsive design. My design isn't top notch so if I had more time I would find som inspiration for improving it.
