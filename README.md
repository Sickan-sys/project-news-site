# News Site

My first project. Hopefully it meets the requirements! The goal was to create a newssite that was responsive, adapting to diffrent screen sizes.


## The problem

 Sometimes it feels like I'm just pressing a bunch of buttons and see what happens. Please let me know if something's wrong with the link. Or if you could se that I have imported the project the wrong way. Should I be Honest and say that this is my third attempt at the project? It is very basic.
 
 
For next time? Do pictures properly. Ad more links to social media. With some form of effect on icons. Maybe have a more responsive design. My design isn't top notch so if I had more time I would find som inspiration for improving it. I should look up min/max sizing.
Probably needed som adapting to larger screen sizes. And not PANIC.
